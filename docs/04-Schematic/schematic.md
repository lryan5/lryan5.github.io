## Overview

This schematic is primarily designed to support the external IR sensor of the AutoCan. This sensor will detect when a user wishes to open the trash can and send a signal to the motor subsystem to open. This schematic also has front facing LEDs to inform the user if the level or weight of the trash inside reachces a critical amount and requires taking out.
