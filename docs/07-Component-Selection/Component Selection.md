![OPB732](OPB732.jpg) <br>Option 3 <br>TT Electronics OPB732 Through Hole IR LED <br> $4.61 each <br>[link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tt-electronics-optek-technology/OPB732/1637069) | • Currently have 1 device<br>• Setup is known | • Short viewing distance<br>• More expensive |

**Choice:** Option 2: Vishay BPW96B Through Hole Photo Transistor

**Rationale:** For our products operation we don’t need a precise distance calculation. As long as the IR sensor can detect an object within a set range, the product’s operation can be activated. Also, option 2 will be able to pick up the signals we want without interference due to its lower viewing angle. Option 2 is less expensive than the other choices, allowing our customers to pay less for the finished device.
