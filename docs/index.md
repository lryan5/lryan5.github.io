## Introduction

* This datasheet site shows the progress and steps taken to produce the External IR sensor and UI lights subsystem schematic for Team 202's Autocan: Automatic Trash Can project. This subsystem detects the user's desire to open the trash can and communicates what state the device is in through LEDs.

### Project Summary

* For our (Team 202's) project, we decided to design an automatic trash can that improved on the shortcomings of the trash cans that are currently on the market. We wanted to make our device as helpful as possible to the busy homeowner who may have pets or children while keeping any unpleasant smell contained. To accomplish this, we used an external IR sensor to detect when the user wants to thrw trash into the device. Then the IR sensor will send a signal to the motorized lid to open as quickly as possible whilst also blinking a blue LED to inform the user that an action is taking place. For extra convenience, a weight sensor and internal IR sensor will be used to detect when the trash is almost too heavy for the bag or reaching the top of the can respectively. These sensors will send a signal to the External IR sensor and LEDs to turn on a red LED, notifying the user to take out the trash.

For all the sections

My part in the Autocan project was to design the external IR sensor and UI lights. To do this I did research and designed parts that would function well together to complete this taks. The following are the major steps I have taken in designing my subsystem.

* To view my Block Diagram, click [here.](https://lryan5.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) This part of the design process shows the general idea of how my PCB will function and the connections to each sensor it will use to carry out the required task.
* To view my Component Selection, click [here.](https://lryan5.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component%20Selection/) This part of the design process displays the major pieces that I need to obtain in order to create my subsystem. Also, showing the array of parts I reviewed to find the part that would fit my design best
* To view my Schematic, click [here.](https://lryan5.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) This part of the design process shows my schematic for my subsystem that was created using KiCad 9.0.
* To view my Power Budget, click [here.](https://lryan5.github.io/05-Power-Budget/PB/) This part of the design process shows the power that all of my parts are expected to draw in order to choose the correct value fuse for the power supply.
