This will make it easier for us to see that data and words that are to be displayed on it. Also, this display uses the same I2C interface as the smaller one meaning that the programming of it should be on the same difficulty as the one supplied in class. However, there are more pins on this display, but they seem to be optional pins that allow for extra customization.
