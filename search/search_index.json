If the Curiosity Nano receives a full signal from the weight sensor or the interior IR sensor through the communication connector, the front LED will start blinking red, informing the user to replace or compact the trash.</p> <p>The power source for this subsystem will be a 9V power supply from a wall connected barrel-jack, or a 9V and 5V transfer from another subsystem through the communication connectors.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#external-ir-sensor-and-user-interface-lights-block-diagram","title":"External IR Sensor and User Interface Lights Block Diagram","text":"<p>Here is the block diagram for Lia Ryan's Subsystem.</p> <p></p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component%20Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component%20Selection/#ir-sensor","title":"IR Sensor","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component%20Selection/#photo-transistor","title":"Photo Transistor","text":"Solution Pros Cons Option 1 Vishay BPW34 Through Hole Photo Transistor $1.23 each link * Small Size  * More precise distance * More expensive  * Higher viewing angle Solution Pros Cons Option 2  Vishay BPW96B Through Hole Photo Transistor  *$0.95 each  link Less expensive  Lower Viewing angle Less precise distance  Large size Solution Pros Cons Option 3 TT Electronics OPB732 Through Hole IR LED  $4.61 each link \u2022 Currently have 1 device\u2022 Setup is known \u2022 Short viewing distance\u2022 More expensive <p>Choice: Option 2: Vishay BPW96B Through Hole Photo Transistor</p> <p>Rationale: For our products operation we don\u2019t need a precise distance calculation. As long as the IR sensor can detect an object within a set range, the product\u2019s operation can be activated. Also, option 2 will be able to pick up the signals we want without interference due to its lower viewing angle. Option 2 is less expensive than the other choices, allowing our customers to pay less for the finished device.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component%20Selection/#ir-led","title":"IR LED","text":"Solution Pros Cons Option 1TSAL6100 Through Hole IR LED$0.49 eachlink \u2022 High radiant intensity\u2022 Lower viewing angle \u2022 Need to construct housing\u2022 Need to create an attachment to PIC Solution Pros Cons Option 2 TSAL6200 Through Hole IR LED$0.49 each link \u2022 Higher stock\u2022 Stable over operating temperature \u2022 Higher viewing angle\u2022 Lower radiant intensity\u2022 Need to construct housing\u2022 Need to create an attachment to PIC Solution Pros Cons Option 3TT Electronics OPB732 Through Hole IR LED$4.61 eachlink \u2022 Currently have 1 device\u2022 Setup is known \u2022 Short viewing distance\u2022 Expensive <p>Choice: Option 1: TSAL6100 Through Hole IR LED</p> <p>Rationale: This LED Is easier to work with and should give more exact results than the other options. The product shouldn\u2019t be triggered automatically; with the narrow viewing angle of this LED, only a small area will be the trigger area compared to the TSAL6200.
